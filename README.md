# ASSIGNMENT 1

<<<<<<< HEAD
Adam Louie, Douglas Yu, Steven Liu
=======
- [x] create dicts for other identifiers: keywords(subset of id), delimiters/separators, operators
- [x] implement isdigit() (do we have to use our fsm or can we just use .isnumeric())
- [x] implement isID() //takes string and returns true if it passes as an id
- [x] implement isreal()
- [x] implement lexer() function - takes in buffer/lexeme and returns token + lexem
- [x] create the main loop - reads through input file char by char from input.txt - adds chars into 'buffer' until hitting a separator/delimiter (also account for cases like >=) - once you hit a separator, call lexer function that returns token + lexeme - write token + lexeme into output file - [x] clear buffer to start recognizing next token
- [x] write 3 test cases and include in zip file
- [x] account for comments [*, *]
